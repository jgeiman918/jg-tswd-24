# Wireframes / storyboards

I used Shorthand to complete the general storyboard/first draft data story. I included and added some sketches of data visualizations I am working on creating from my data sources. The data I'm working with from the FBI Crime Data Explorer is more unweildy to work with than I anticipated, so for now the sketches serve as placeholders for the visualizations and will be updated with charts/graphs I create (I am working primarily in Tableau, but may use RAWGraphs or a similar platform to create a timeline of key events during the protests).

As a note, given the size of the datasets and the amount of restructuring I am having to do (joining multiple sets and performing other cleaning) I have narrowed the focus to the BLM protests in the summer of 2020 rather than providing comparative analysis of other protests. This is also due to the fact that the FBI datasets only go up to 2022, and therefore key recent protests including the Gaza demonstrations that began in fall 2023 would not be visible in the data.

Here is the [link](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/3333695b-81b2-4e6b-b4ff-3049c98d85bf/index.html) to the Shorthand story draft/storyboard, which was shared with interviewees for feedback.

# User research 

## Target audience
My target audience is essentially individuals in my peer group--since I will be presenting the story to fellow CMU students, I had my peers in mind while creating this initial storyboard and writing the narrative portions. I think many of my peers have varying degrees of awareness about the 2020 protests and the history of police brutality and anti-blackness in the US, but may not have dug deep into some of the more legal or policing issues surrounding them or may otherwise benefit from learning a bit more about these events. I think the ideal audience member is sympathetic to the cause of these protests (i.e., has an interest in peace, equality, civil rights, etc.) but maybe hasn't participated extensively in protests themselves or has been a bit more of a bystander--whether out of fear of consequences or feeling as if they don't know quite enough to take such a public stance as protesting. My peers, being policy students, may feel more inclined to try to influence change through the system (changing policy, taking office, etc.) versus taking direct action through grassroots movements. I would hope my audience comes away with more interest in how they can express their voice and see direct action through protesting as a complementary strategy to systems work/policy change.

## Interview script
In coming up with interview questions, I was interested in learning and validating several things:

1) Particularly since this can be a sensitive topic, does the tone feel appropriate, balanced, and respectful of the people most impacted by these events? Is the language used appropriate, respectful, and non-imflammatory?
2) Were the draft visualization types appropriate for what I hope to show using the data available to me, and were there "pain points" where the visualizations felt cluttered, confusing, or out of place in the broader story?
3) Is the storyline cohesive? Does the narrative arc feel complete, or are there parts where there could be more clarification/expansion--or parts that are superfluous?

From these goals, I developed the following questions:

1) What is your impression of the overall tone of the data story (including visual atmosphere e.g. use of color and images, as well as verbal tone of the narrative and descriptions)?
2) Who do you think the intended audience is? Do you feel this audience is effectively reached?
3) Keeping the audience in mind, do you feel the story is unbalanced or excessively biased towards one point of view? 
4) Did the visualizations (graphs/charts) feel appropriate and clear? What points of confusion were there?
5) Were you interested in the concepts/stories the visualizations were attempting to highlight? What do you wish you'd learned or still feel curious about?
6) Is there anything you would add or remove from the calls to action at the end?
7) Any miscellaneous feedback?


## Interview findings

I interviewed three peers with the following demographics: (a) 24y, F, queer, white; (b) 26y, F, queer, white; (c) 28y, F, queer, Latina. All are Heinz students in the PPM track and all are native-born US citizens. All describe their political/ideological leanings as left of center.

Summarized below are the key takeaways/feedback aggregated from all respondents for each question:

1) What is your impression of the overall tone of the data story (including visual atmosphere e.g. use of color and images, as well as verbal tone of the narrative and descriptions)?

- The use of color (black and white with red callout/highlight) was described as "somber," "grave," "morbid," and "frustrating." One respondent said the use of red against the black and white made her feel alert, calling attention to key information. The verbal tone was described as "even-keeled" with one respondent highlighting the use of facts and statistics gave it a more journalistic feel. Respondents indicated the serious tone and use of black and white felt appropriate to the subject given its seriousness.

2) Who do you think the inteded audience is? Do you feel this audience is effectively reached?

- Respondents identified the audience as people who had been interested in or sympathetic to the Black Lives Matter movement and related protests, particularly those looking to get more involved; or people who are "left-leaning and interested in social justice work." Only one respondent said that the audience could be "all Americans" as this is an issue that should be relevant to everyone and all Americans could benefit from information about their protest rights.
  
3) Keeping the audience in mind, do you feel the story is unbalanced or excessively biased towards one point of view? 

- One respondent indicated that there is clear bias or intent to communicate with audiences who are left-leaning, so more conservative audiences may lose interest or be turned off by the topic in general as well as the approach. This respondent suggested that if a broader audience were intended, the order of the story could be shifted to first focus on the arrest data and then move into the more narrative/contextual elements in order to "hook" a more centric audience with the data before discussing the social context. The other two respondents felt that the tone and approach was "as balanced as you could be" while still presenting the context of the issue, and that it did a good job presenting facts "without being accusatory."

4) Did the visualizations (graphs/charts) feel appropriate and clear? What points of confusion were there?

- Respondents thought the visualizations were appropiate and one respondent positively highlighted the dashed lines showing certain key event dates e.g. the date of George Floyd's murder as well as the timing of curfew orders. One respondent had helpful editing comments on one graph: "On the chart explaining arrests over time, I don't think you need to add the date (May 25, 2020) along the x-axis because you're also calling it out on the red line above. The red line is more effective because the x-axis label initially confused me since it didn't fit the first of the month trend for other labels."

5) Were you interested in the concepts/stories the visualizations were attempting to highlight? What do you wish you'd learned or still feel curious about?

- One respondent said she liked showing the breakdown of violent vs. nonvoilent arrests, but felt that it wasn't necessary to break down the nonviolent arrests by type. Another said that the map showing locations of protests was effective as it showed the scale of the movement (author note: this was a graph pulled from the NYT--trying to find data to recreate it in the style of the rest of my visualizations, but TBD). 

6) Is there anything you would add or remove from the calls to action at the end?

- One respondent said she felt a bit confused about the calls to action as the buttons to know your rights, donate to bail funds, and find local protests "felt more like resources" rather than a specific call to action. She suggested having a more clear call to action in a separate section, and then more clearly noting that the other links are general resources. Another respondent suggested reworking the resource buttons in Shorthand to get them to align better visually, as they are a bit jumbled currently/out of line with one another.

7) Any miscellaneous feedback?

- One respondent said that in places where red text is used as a highlight, more context may be necessary since people may naturally just read the highlight text first and currently it's not always clear what that text refers to. "For instance, "between 16 and 25 million people joining protests" or "over 13,000 arrests" or "68 arrests per day." The logic here is that people might just read the number or headings first and be left with other ideas... I saw protests and then "over 13,000" in red, but realized that the number was for arrests, not protests." Another respondent suggested using a darker background for the states in the US protests map to better fit with the overall style and theme.

# Identified changes for Part III

I thought the feedback was very helpful in validating my choice of color and tone as well as the visualization types. I do plan to implement the changes suggested about adding context and being careful with my use of the red highlight to call out specific statistics, to make sure it's clear if someone were to only read the red text that they would still understand the full concept being called out. I am also hoping to be able to redo the protest map so that it fits with the style and theme of the other visualizations. This could also open oppoprtunities to add some animation to the story, e.g. starting with the broad US map and then zooming into the protests located in Minneapolis/St. Paul or vice versa (to show how what started in Minneapolis spread to the rest of the country). I think one respondent's comment about eliminating the date of Floyd's death on the x-axis of the chart was also helpful and I plan to implement that change so that I don't include redundant information in the graph. Finally, I have been considering if and how I should broaden the audience--however, I am not sure how much this is feasible, since many people by this point are likely to be somewhat entrenched in their views about a topic like this. I think I am less interested in changing people's minds about BLM, but more interested in encouraging people interested in joining protests or who may become interested in protests to take steps to be safe and organized and be as effective as possible. Therefore I don't think I will implement the change suggested about starting with the data and panning out to the context as one respondent suggested--but if I have time, I may play around with it to see how it changes the framing and then go back to that respondent and see if she thinks it's more effective.
