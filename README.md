# About me
My name is J (they/them) and I'm a second-year graduate student at Carnegie Mellon's Heinz College in the MSPPM track. Originally from Chicago, I most recently lived in Washington, DC for three years where I worked as a Program Officer at the National Democratic Institute and later as a Policy Analyst specializing in postsecondary education policy at the Center for Law and Social Policy. I have a BA in Russian Language and Literature from the University of Pittsburgh. I enjoy data visualization as a way to link my interests in design, communications, and statistics and I'm excited to continue to develop my skills through the Telling Stories with Data course!

# What I hope to learn
I hope to gain several skills from thw TSWD course, including:

1. Best practices for improving readibility of data visualizations with a special attention to accessibility.
2. Creative approaches to complex data stories and nontraditional types of visualizations -- including interactive and dynamic visualizations that allow the reader to participate in exploring the data.
3. Ways to avoid common pitfalls in data visualization and keep visualizations from becoming cluttered and confusing.
